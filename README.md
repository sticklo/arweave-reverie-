REVERIE
This project demonstrates a decentralized content gating mechanism using Arweave's AO (Arweave Overlay) for backend computation and a custom token for access. Users can mint tokens on the AO network via a simple frontend, which then grants them access to exclusive content.

‚ú® Features
AO Backend: Leverages the AO computing environment for secure and scalable token management and content gating logic.
Custom Token: Implements a custom token (e.g., "Content Access Token" or "CAT") that users mint to gain access.
Frontend Interface: A clean, intuitive web interface built with HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.
Wallet Integration: Connects securely using ArConnect for wallet management and transaction signing.
Dynamic UI: Displays real-time token balance, token information (name, ticker, mint price), and provides a clear minting flow.
Gated Content: Illustrates how content can be hidden or revealed based on a user's token ownership.
üöÄ How It Works
Connect Wallet: Users connect their Arweave wallet via ArConnect.
View Token Info: The frontend fetches and displays details about the Content Access Token and its mint price.
Mint Tokens: Users can mint tokens by sending a specified amount of AR to the AO vault process.
Access Content: Once a user holds at least one token, the exclusive content becomes visible in the UI.
üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm/yarn (for installing ao-sdk if needed for deployment script).
ArConnect browser extension.
An Arweave wallet with some AR for minting.
Setup
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Deploy the AO Vault Process:

Ensure your vault.lua file is correctly configured (e.g., with initial creator, mintPrice, name, ticker).
Deploy your vault.lua process to AO. This will give you a unique Process ID.
Example deployment command (using aos CLI or similar):
Bash

aos deploy vault.lua
Keep track of the deployed Process ID.
Configure the Frontend:

Open index.html in a text editor.
Locate the state object in the JavaScript section.
Update the processId field with the Process ID obtained from your AO vault deployment:
JavaScript

const state = {
    // ... other state properties
    processId: "YOUR_DEPLOYED_VAULT_PROCESS_ID", // <--- UPDATE THIS
    // ...
};
(Optional) If you have a separate token process for a aoTokenProcessId (like a PNTS token), update that too.
Open the Frontend:

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser (e.g., file:///path/to/your/project/index.html).
üöÄ Usage
Connect Wallet: Click the "Connect Wallet" button and approve the connection in ArConnect.
View Details: Your wallet address, token balance, and token details (Name, Ticker, Mint Price) should appear.
Mint Tokens: Click the "Mint 1 Token" button. Approve the transaction in ArConnect.
Access Content: Once the minting transaction is confirmed on AO and your balance updates, the gated content will become visible.
